Little quiz app in python for my spanish class

This is a simple flashcard-like memorization app written in python.
It parses file using the following format:

- Blank lines and lines beginning with a "#" are also ignored
- Lines with vocab are of the format: `<spanish_word(s)> | <english_word(s)`
    - the "|" character separates the spanish from the english on a given line
